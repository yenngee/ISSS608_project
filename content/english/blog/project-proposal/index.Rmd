#### This is our project proposal 
Where it all started. 


# Introduction
The goal of the annual Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is to advance the field of visual analytics through competition. The 2021 IEEE VAST Challenge brings back a classic challenge from 2014 to see how approaches and techniques have developed since the original release of the challenge.
The background of the challenge is as below:

In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.

In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.

# Objective
We found suspicious activities within GAStech itself worth investigating, thus, this project aims to create an data analytics applications to visualize these suspicious activities and relationships for you to judge, who exactly are the suspicious people in GASTech.

This project aims to understand better the individuals and organizations that are involved in this situation. We do this by exploring the following:

* Doing exploration data analysis and inferential data analysis on 
  + Credit card expenditure data 
  + Email headers data
  + Employee categories 

We will do so by delivering an R-Shiny app that achieve the following through an interactive user interface design: 
* Identifying any anomalous or suspicious behavior.
* Identifying formal (work-related) or informal (non-work related) relationships.
  + Discover any associations based on common interest given in the data.
  + Discover relationships between CC expenditure [MC2] and email headers + employee records [MC1]
* Decide who are the suspicious GASTech employees 
* Obtaining a holistic profile on these suspicious employees

# Datasets
Weâ€™ll be using data sets from Mini-Challenge 1 [MC1] and Mini-Challenge 2 [MC2].

From [MC1], we will be using the email headers and employee records data.
From [MC2], we will be extracting insights based on credit card transactions data.

We will also be joining the two data sets based on individuals to analyzing attributes by features across data sets.

# Scope and Methodology 

Our scope and methodology is as below:

1. Data preparation using dplyr and other r packages
2. Analysis of VAST 21 data set with background research using some of the following methods:
  + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods in R
  + Network Analysis in R
3. Creating a R shiny dashboard showing our findings/insights and conclusions:
  + R Markdown development for functionality checks
  + R-Shiny app development for user interactivity

# Storyboard
### Layout 
We start off with the main layout of our app:
![](../../images/blog/project_proposal/1_layout.png)

This will consist of two pain parts: 

1. the top navigation bar that will help the user to navigate to the various modules that will be present in the blue area. 
2. an input bar where user can decide for themselves who in GASTech is suspicious. 

The objective of this layout is when the user switch from one tab to another, based on the visualization and their own analysis, they are able to decide for themselves who they think are the most suspicious. Then at the end (in module 4), we would see the profile of the user's decision of their most suspected employees. 

Subsequently, the modules below will fill in the blue coloured area in the layout above: 
### Module 1: What do they spend on? 

![](../../images/blog/project_proposal/2a_cc.png)

This would be the EDA portion. On the side panel, we would include options for interactions. Then on the main panel, we will have histogram and data table. 

**Filters**

* Employee Category - there will be a drop down for each possible employee category. We may or may not include all of the employee categories stated below, and we may add more than what is stated below as we work on our data. 
  + Department (drop down: Security, Executive, Administration ... )
  + Gender (drop down: Female, Male)
  + Employment Year (numeric slider)
  + ...
* Expenditure Category 
  + Expenditure type (drop down: food, retail, etc )
  + company vs non-company expenditure 
* Time Category
  + Weekend vs Weekday 

**Viz Settings**

* nr of bins
* selection of columns for data table

**Viz Interaction features**

* if we select a histogram bar, the Data Table will be automatically filtered 
* tooltip appears when we hover around histogram 

### Module 2: What do they spend on?

![](../../images/blog/project_proposal/2b_cc.png)
This would be the inferential portion. 

3 sub tabs for the 3 types of filters defined in Module 1: 

* Employee Category 
* Expenditure Category
* Time Category

The x axis will reflect the selection in each of the category. 

ANOVA inferential statistics will be done. 

### Module 3: 

![](../../images/blog/project_proposal/3_email.png)
On the side panel, we would include options for interactions. Then on the main panel, we will have the network graph. 

**Filters**

* Employee Category - similar to that in Module 1
* Email Category (work related vs non-work related)

**Viz Settings**

* Network Metric
  + In-degree & Out-degree (directed emails) [will do] 
  + Betweenness centrality  [will do] 
  + Closeness Centrality [if got time]
  + Eigenvector Centrality  [if got time]
  + Clustering Coefficient [if got time]
* Layout (igraph) 
  + sphere
  + circle
  + random
  + fr


**Viz Interaction features**

* if we select a single node, the nearby connections will be highlighted 
* tooltip appears when we hover around the nodes



### Module 4: 

![](../../images/blog/project_proposal/4_parallel.png)

On the side panel, we would include options for interactions. Then on the main panel, we will have the parallel set graph. 

**input**

The suspicious vs non-suspicious categorization would be done by the user at the bottom of the app. Which will then be feed into this parallel plot to see the profile suspicious vs non-suspicious employees. 

**Viz Settings**

* Selection of levels (depends on our graph maybe up to 5/6?)
* selection for each level will be the employee category defined in module 1 

**Viz Interaction features**

* if we select a single path way, it will be highlighted 
* tooltip also appears showing all the names?
